## Project Abstraction

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate data mining and machine learning techniques using the record data of COVID-19 cases in the worldwide range for the spread pattern analysis of the pandemic and forecast the future new positive case trends in the United States of America. Modeling focused on the following data features: report date, number of populations, latitude and longitude, the average age of the people, GDP of the countries or states, total area space, and land area space, and COVID-19 cases (positive cases and death cases). The best model was the Random Forest Regressor which was selected using the Hyperparameter Tuning technique to correctly predict the people positive new cases 94% of the time. The feature with the most information gained as assessed by Random Forest Regression was GDP and report date. Additionally, Linear Regression was used to interpret each featureâ€™s positive or negative effects on the model with 35% accuracy. Finally, use the advanced time-series analysis GARCH model to predict the future positive new cases trend for each state in the United States of America to assist medical resources arrangement and as a reference to the future trend of the spread of infectious disease.
